## My Challenges

It's my first project with Typescript. It was hard for me cuz I haven't dealt before with the defined types of variables, functions... I guess it helps me out in the production when I'd like to publish to the world. I'm glad that I did it and I repeated some React hooks. I'm excited to move to a new E commerce project. It's a bigger one but I hope I can do it.
